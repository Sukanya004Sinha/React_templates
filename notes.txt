What is hooks ?
Hooks is just a normal function. just like normal function

What is useState hooks?
useState hooks is used to create local state variables 
useState hooks returns an array, array has the first Items has variable name 

If we have a local variable then why we need state variable?

Suppose we have a local variable a= 10  and some other component change that local variable 
react will not know i get changed so react keeps a track of each state variable and whenever i am updating that state variable it will automatically re-render my component
